<ul>
  <li>ðŸŒ± I'm a student at 42MÃ¡laga.</li>
  <li>ðŸ’¬ About me: Right now i'm focusing my self on my studies at 42 while working at the same time, so i can't espent the amount of time i would like to programing, wich is, one of my passions, but im still working to improve my skills and learn more about C, C++ and Java.

          <td>
            The main objective of the Libft project is to gain a deep understanding of how the standard functions in C work by programming them from scratch. This practice helps to strengthen the foundations of programming in                          C and promotes an understanding of memory manipulation, string handling, linked lists, and other fundamental concepts.

              The Printf project aims to create a custom implementation of the printf function in C, allowing me to deepen my understanding of output formatting, handling variable arguments, and type conversion. This project is                          essential for gaining a better understanding of string manipulation and formatted output in C.</td>

            The objective of the Get Next Line project is to implement a function in C that reads a line from a file descriptor, handling multiple descriptors simultaneously and managing dynamic memory allocation efficiently. This project              helps in understanding concepts such as the use of static variables and file manipulation in C.

            The main objective of the Push_swap project is to develop efficient sorting algorithms that can sort a stack of integers in ascending order using a limited set of instructions. Where you must implement two programs: one that                sorts the stack of numbers and another that verifies if a given set of instructions correctly sorts the stack.

            The main objective of the Philosophers project is to solve the dining philosophers problem using concurrent programming. This project focuses on avoiding deadlocks and race conditions in multithreaded applications through the              use of mutexes and semaphores. Students must implement a solution where multiple philosophers share a limited number of resources (forks) without encountering deadlocks or starvation.

          The main objective of the Minishell project is to understand and replicate the behavior of a basic Unix shell, such as Bash. This project involves implementing a command interpreter that can execute commands, manage                        environment variables, handle redirections and pipes, and respond to user signals. It is a complex project that introduces us to fundamental concepts in systems programming.
